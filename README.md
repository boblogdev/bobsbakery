## User Experience
### Initial Discussion

Bob's Bakery is a local, family-owned bakery in the heart of Gateshead. They sell a wide-range of sweet goods as well as savoury goods. Bob's Bakery would like to increase their footfall, and want to do this by having an online presence. 

Bob's Bakery would also like to interact with their customers through social media and direct contact.


### Demographic
With the site being in the heart of Gateshead, and there being a travel hub within the building, there is a wide range to cater for. Below I have listed what they may be interested in.

  - Teens 
    - Sweet tasty cakes, doughnuts and cookies etc.
  - Students
    - Quick, convenient food such as pasties, sausage rolls, pre-made sandwiches etc.
  - Young Professionals
    - Meal deals(sandwich, crisps and drink)
  - Families
    - Bread, Pastries, and personalized cakes(incl birthday cakes).

### Strategic Trade offs

| Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Viability/Feasability |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Create an online presence | 5 | 5 |
| Display a wide range of produce on the site | 4 | 5 |
| Increase social media interaction | 5 | 5 |
| Create a click and collect system| 3 | 1 |
| Email marketing campaign | 2 | 2 |
| Total | 19 | Avg 18 |

Above I have listed documented some trade-offs and I will explain the reasoning behind them.

- Online presence
  - This is mandatory and should be achievable given that I am a Front-End Web Developer(the course upto now has given everything I need to achieve this).

- Produce Range
  - Not as important as an online presence, but most definitely still up there. I feel it is also feasible given my skillset

- Social media interaction
  - Again, this is well within my skillset as this could be something as simple as a CTA or footer icons with links to social media.

- Click & Collect
  - In order to get a click & collect system similar(Just-Eat) to other sites I would need to expand my knowledge.This isn't something I feel I have the knowledge for at the moment, so the feasiblity for it scores a one. However, this doesn't mean that it won't be implemented in future updates.

- Email marketing
  - This could involve a signup form and database of customer emails. There is technology that would handle this for me however I don't feel I have the time or knowledge to implement this.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

We wanted to use a colour scheme that wasn't going to distract too much from the text but also make the website pop, and look fun. From the competitors websites, I found a lot of local bakeries were tending to use pastel type colours.

NOTE:

I felt that the color scheme did not accurately represent the atmosphere and values of Bob's Bakery, and it did not match the theme of being "Warm and Welcoming." The color scheme below is what was used in the final product.

### Typography

We decided that we didn't want to overcomplicate the typography, and settled on Roboto, with a fallback font of Sans-serif. 

Font weights for Roboto are regular(400) and medium(500). Regular is used for the text on the pages and medium is used for headings. 

### Imagery

Being a local, family-owned bakery, we decided to opt in for images that are warm & welcoming. Using imagery we want to also convey that the bakery is open to all.

Bob's Bakery Sitemap

Wireframes were initially created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamiq Wireframes Software") on Ubuntu however there were some limitations which resulted in me switching to Windows 10 version.


## Technologies Used

### Languages Used 
* HTML and CSS
* JavaScript - however this was the Hamburger Dropdown from Bootstrap.

### Software, Frameworks & Libraries Used

* [Balsamiq](https://www.balsamiq.com/wireframes "Balsamiq Wireframing Tool") was used to create the wireframes/sitemap for the site.
* [Bootstrap Version 4.6 ](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/ "Bootstrap Framework") was used to create the navigation bar, cards and form. They were modified to my suit needs. As a personal note to future myself, whilst Bootstrap is a excellent framework to get stuck into I feel it pulls away from the practising of core CSS, resulting in a lot of overriding.
* [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "Canva") was used to create Bob's Bakery Logo, Favicon and to also get some potential ideas. This was also used to create the menu pdf shown in the navbar.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons "Font Awesome 6.2.1 Free Icons") was used for the stars icons seen on the reviews page and the social media icons in the footer.
* [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/ "Firefox Developer Edition") this was used to find out specific measurements with the ruler tool so that each page had exactly the same padding between the last section row and footer.
* [Google Fonts](fonts.google.com "Google Fonts") we used the Satisfy font and also the Roboto font. These can been seen in action as page-headings/slogan-text and in the navbar.
* Google Dev Tools were utilized to identify and resolve problems related to responsiveness and appearance. 
* [Github](https://github.com/ "Github") was used to store my project in a repository. 
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git Version Control") was used for Version Control.
* [Google](https://www.google.co.uk "Google Search Engine") was used to research HTML & CSS.
* [Gitpod](https:://www.gitpod.io "Gitpod Cloud IDE") the vast majority of my time was spent inside GitPod's VSCode Cloud IDE.
* CDNs [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/what-is-cloudflare/ "Cloudflare CDN") and  [JsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/ "JsDelivr") were used for Font Awesome icons CSS minified and Bootstrap 4.6 CSS minified.
* Pomodoro Timer - to stop me from procrastinating.
